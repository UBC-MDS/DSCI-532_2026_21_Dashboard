## Description

This dashboard visualizes the spread of the invasive Japanese beetle (*Popillia japonica*) using GBIF occurrence records, including citizen-science observations from iNaturalist. Users can explore where and when sightings have occurred, identify potential hotspots, and view trends over time. The goal is to support awareness and decision-making for residents, growers, and policy makers in British Columbia and beyond.
